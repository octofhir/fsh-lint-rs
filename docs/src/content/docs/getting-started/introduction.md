FSH Lint is a fast, powerful linter for FHIR Shorthand (FSH) files.

## What is FSH?

FHIR Shorthand (FSH) is a domain-specific language created to simplify the creation
of FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs). It allows you to define FHIR resources, profiles,
extensions, and value sets in a concise, human-readable format.

## Why FSH Lint?

Writing FSH by hand can be error-prone. FSH Lint helps you:

- **Catch errors early** - Find issues before SUSHI compilation
- **Maintain consistency** - Enforce naming conventions and style guides
- **Follow best practices** - Learn FHIR/FSH patterns from built-in rules
- **Save time** - Auto-fix many issues automatically
- **Customize validation** - Write custom rules for your organization

## Key Features

### Built in Rust ðŸ¦€

FSH Lint is written in Rust for maximum performance and reliability. It can lint
thousands of FSH files in seconds.

### Comprehensive Rules

- **Correctness**: Catch logical errors and invalid FSH
- **Style**: Maintain consistent formatting and naming
- **Documentation**: Ensure proper descriptions and metadata
